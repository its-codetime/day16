          <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such
            as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host
            environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
            connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the
            webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server
            can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.

          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages
            interactive. JavaScript is a dynamic language, which means that it
            is interpreted by the web browser. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm
            language, which means that it supports object-oriented, imperative,
            and functional programming styles. JavaScript is an object-oriented
            language, which means that it uses objects to represent data and
            functions to represent behavior. JavaScript is an event-driven
            language, which means that it uses events to handle user
            interaction. JavaScript is a client-side language, which means that
            it is used on the client side of the web page. JavaScript is a
            server-side language, which means that it is used on the server side
            of the web page.

          <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting language, which means that it is used to
            create scripts. JavaScript is a compiled language, which means that
            it is compiled into machine code. JavaScript is a high-level
            language, which means that it is written in a high-level syntax.
            JavaScript is a low-level language, which means that it is written
            in a low-level syntax. JavaScript is a dynamic language, which means
            that it is interpreted by the web browser. JavaScript is a

            object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

          <h2>A brief history of JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in
            1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language
            for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.
            Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to
            JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java
            language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from
            some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no
            way related to the Java programming language.
          </p>

          <p>
            After its release, more and more browsers started adding JavaScript
            support. Still, for much of its history JavaScript was not regarded
            as a serious programming language. Its earliest releases suffered
            from notable performance and security issues, but developers had no
            alternatives. If they wanted to run programs in the browser, they
            had to use JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2008, the creation of Google's open-source Chrome V8, a
            high-performance JavaScript engine, provided a crucial turning point
            for JavaScript. The subsequent proliferation of fast JavaScript
            engines made it possible for developers to build sophisticated
            browser-based applications with performance that competed with
            desktop and mobile applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after, Ryan Dahl released an open-source, cross-platform
            environment called Node.js. It provided a way to run JavaScript code
            from outside a browser. It freed JavaScript from the browser's
            confines and led directly to JavaScript's current popularity. Today,
            you can use JavaScript to write all kinds of applications, including
            browser, server, mobile, and desktop applications. Most major online
            companies today, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and Google,
            all use JavaScript in their products.
